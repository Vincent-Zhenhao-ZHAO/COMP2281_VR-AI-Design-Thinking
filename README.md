## For Contributors

1\. Clone the repository (if you are a new contributor)

    git clone https://github.com/Vincent-Zhenhao-ZHAO/COMP2281_VR-AI-Design-Thinking

2\. The VR room contains all functions need for the VR Design Thinking Process. Three different room: BrainStorming room, Focus On User room and relax room.
    
    - BrainStorming Room: Pen, whiteboard, table, desk and sofa. Player able to grab pen and write things on the whiteboard. There are some structures provided

3\. How functions work in the unity:

    - Pen: There is a prefab called pen in asset/whiteboard. You can just drop it in the scence and use it without set anything. When you click the feature of pen,
      you can set the size of pen as well.
    - Whiteboard: There is a prefab called whiteboard in asset/whiteboard. You can just drop it in the scence and use it without set anything. You can also set the       size as well.
    - notes on the wall: if you want to change the information on the wall, just click the text, it will show left side, then click button/text. Then change things       on right side.
