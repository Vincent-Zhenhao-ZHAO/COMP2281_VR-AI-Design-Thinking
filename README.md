    - Pen: There is a prefab called pen in asset/whiteboard. You can just drop it in the scence and use it without set anything. When you click the feature of pen,
      you can set the size of pen as well.
    - Whiteboard: There is a prefab called whiteboard in asset/whiteboard. You can just drop it in the scence and use it without set anything. You can also set the       size as well.
